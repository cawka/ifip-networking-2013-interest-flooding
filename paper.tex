\begin{abstract}

Distributed Denial of Service attack is an ongoing problem in today's Internet. 
A newly proposed future Internet architecture, Named Data Networking (NDN), lets end users request desired data by sending Interest packets, and the network forwards data packets to end users upon request only. 
Thus, NDN can effectively defeat the existing DDoS attacks, however it can be subject to new types of DoS attacks, namely Interest packet flooding.  
In this paper we investigate effective solutions to mitigate Interest flooding attacks. 
We use simulations to evaluate the design and our results show that our proposed solution can respond to Interest flooding attacks quickly, and that the inherent flow-balance property of NDN (i.e., one Interest packet retrieves at most one Data packet) can be used as a basis for effective DDoS mitigation algorithms.

Basic limits, probablity based on statistics, and dynamic window adjustment

\section{Evaluation}
\todo{Both simulation, as well as emulation for various sized topologies (trees as well as real topologies), various parameters etc.
List all possible parameters, say clearly which ones we vary, and which ones we do not, along with explanations.

Metrics that we will consider in our evaluation (Satisfaction rate for good clients, Link utilization near producers, Latency for good clients, good versus bad interests as a function of time).}

We want to explore the effectiveness of designed mitigation techniques in a two distinctive ways. First, we need to understand how each method works on a very ground level of a just few nodes and links. Second, we want to pick promising techniques and see if they work in a large scale networks of hundreds and thousands of nodes. To ensure the correct transition from small scale experiments to large scale experiments we had to use the same evaluation tool in order to eliminate any possibility of implementation discrepancy. As of today the only network simulator supporting full NDN logic is the NS-3 based ndnSIM software.
