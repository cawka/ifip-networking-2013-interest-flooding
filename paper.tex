\begin{abstract}

Distributed Denial of Service attack is an ongoing problem in today's Internet. 
A newly proposed future Internet architecture, Named Data Networking (NDN), lets end users request desired data by sending Interest packets, and the network forwards data packets to end users upon request only. 
Thus, NDN can effectively defeat the existing DDoS attacks, however it can be subject to new types of DoS attacks, namely Interest packet flooding.  
In this paper we investigate effective solutions to mitigate Interest flooding attacks. 
We use simulations to evaluate the design and our results show that our proposed solution can respond to Interest flooding attacks quickly, and that the inherent flow-balance property of NDN (i.e., one Interest packet retrieves at most one Data packet) can be used as a basis for effective DDoS mitigation algorithms.
