== Possible attack vectors on NDN ==

* Paper: Y. Chung, "Distributed Denial of Service is a Scalability Problem" in CCR, 2012.
 "push-pull" attack, where "bots" generate interests for data that is generated by another bots

 '''No evaluation'''

* Tobias Lauinger, "Security & Scalability of Content-Centric Networking", Master Thesis, 2010
 Interesting thesis, 
 listing several potential attacks on NDN, including threat of cache enumeration (list, probe, clone)

 '''Evaluation''': DLAM (Digital subscriber line multiplexer) service for youtube-like service. 
 1000 users, with 10% of simultaneous watching. Realistic traffic (actual videos, videos popularity 
 based on Youtube report)

== IP ==

=== Security reports ===

* ARBOR networks, "Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report", Volume VII, 2011
 Partial rank of tools to mitigate attacks: 
   1. ACLs, 2. Dst-based blackholing, ... 5. Src-based blackholing ... ... CDNs
   !! no QoS solutions !! Concerns that rate-limiting will have unintended side effect on legitimate users
 In general, up to 30 minutes to mitigate attack. Some longer.

=== Botnets ===

* Thorsten Holz, Moritz Steiner, Frederic Dahl, Ernst Biersack, Felix Freiling, "Measurements and Mitigation of Peer-to-Peer-based Botnets: A Case Study on Storm Worm", in LEET, 2008
  The lower bound being around 5,000 – 6,000 and the upper bound being around 45,000 – 80,000 distinct bots.
  5,000 and 40,000 peers concurrently online.

* Moheeb Abu Rajab, Jay Zarfoss, Fabian Monrose, Andreas Terzis, "My Botnet is Bigger than Yours (Maybe, Better than Yours) : why size estimates remain challenging", in Hotbots, 2007
  footprint = 48,500 bots over the entire tracking period
  live population = does not exceed 3,000

* network capabilities (aka tickets) with traffic prioritization
* fair queuing (various granularity: source, path, destination; proof-of-work: bandwidth, computation)
* source spoofing protection 
** direct flooding
** reflector flooding
